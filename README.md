# ProducerBuddy
Python program to help organize audio samples.

I have spent the last couple months dedicating myself to making music and during
that time I have been working more and more with samples downloaded from the
internet. Samples are great but it is tedious moving them from my Downloads
folder to my production folder, and even more tedious actually sorting them
from there. This program will aim to make that as painless as possible by first
automatically moving samples to an "Unsorted" folder, and then subsequently will
allow the user to organize samples into a folder hierarchy. Since organizing
samples will require be able to preview samples, playback functionality will be
implemented, including a pitch meter (aka a tuner), to help identify the key of
samples and eventually BPM detection.

Requirements so far:
rumps
pygame
tkinter
